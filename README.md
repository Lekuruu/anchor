# Anchor

Anchor is a bancho server designed for older osu! clients.
It supports every client from b282 up to the latest version that is currently available.

Please view [this repository](https://github.com/osuTitanic/titanic) for setup instructions!

Pretty much everything has been completed now. The only things missing would probably be the irc server.
You can view the todo's [here](https://github.com/users/osuTitanic/projects/2).
