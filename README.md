# Anchor

Anchor is a bancho server designed for older osu! clients.
It supports every client from b282 up to b20130716.
Recently there have been some updates, to implement client versions up to the latest available version, which still needs to be tested.

Please view [this repository](https://github.com/osuTitanic/titanic) for setup instructions!

Pretty much everything has been completed now. The only things missing would probably be the irc server.
You can view the todo's [here](https://github.com/users/osuTitanic/projects/2).
