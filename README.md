# Anchor

Anchor is a bancho server designed for older osu! clients.
It currently supports clients from b1807 to b2013716 and I will try to expand support in the future.

Please view [this repository](https://github.com/osuTitanic/titanic) for setup instructions!

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me: [@Lekuru/Levi](https://github.com/lekuruu)
